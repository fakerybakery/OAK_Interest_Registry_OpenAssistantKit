# OpenAssistantKit Interest Registry

Announcement on September 17, 2023: I'm excited to announce that I'm now working on OpenAssistantKit (OAK). OAK is currently in development/limited testing, but it aims to create a virtual assistant that can perform tasks, such as checking email, sending messages, and creating calendar events. Although OAK is currently closed source, but if it gains enough interest I plan to open-source it eventually.
